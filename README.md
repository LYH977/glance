# Animated Time Series Data Visualization for Geospatial Events

Final Year Project, named Glance, aim to allow users to easily grasp the message delivered by the animated data visualization at a glance.

Glance will be fully developed by Python, both for frontend and backend because Python 
contains a lot of useful library tools such as plotly, numpy, and pandas which are essential to 
plot the animated data visualization. Dash framework will be used in frontend development 
because it is an open-source Python framework used to build analytical web applications. Dash 
is built on top of Plotly.js, React and Flask and bring forth numerous modern UI elements. 
InfluxDb will be integrated into the project.
